## End-to-End Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Complete User Journey

```gherkin
Scenario: User registers, creates portfolio, tracks prices
  Given: System is healthy and ready
  When: New user registers with valid credentials
  Then: User account created successfully
  And: JWT token returned
  
  When: User creates portfolio named "My First Portfolio"
  Then: Portfolio created with ID
  And: Portfolio accessible via API
  
  When: User adds Bitcoin to portfolio (1 BTC @ $45,000)
  Then: Asset added successfully
  And: Current value calculated from live price
  
  When: User views portfolio dashboard
  Then: Portfolio displays total value
  And: Asset allocation calculated
  And: Performance metrics shown
  
  When: User subscribes to price updates via WebSocket
  Then: WebSocket connection established
  And: Real-time price updates received
  And: Portfolio value updated in real-time
```

### Test Scenario 2: Analytics Pipeline

```gherkin
Scenario: Price data flows through analytics pipeline
  Given: Market Data Service connected to Binance
  When: Bitcoin price received from exchange
  Then: Price published to Kafka topic
  
  When: Analytics Service consumes price update
  Then: Moving averages calculated (SMA, EMA)
  And: Volatility computed
  And: Results cached in Redis
  
  When: API requested for analytics
  Then: Results returned from cache (< 100ms)
  And: Accuracy verified against expected values
```

### Test Scenario 3: Sentiment Analysis

```gherkin
Scenario: News articles analyzed for sentiment
  Given: NewsAPI providing crypto articles
  When: New articles ingested for Bitcoin
  Then: Articles stored in database
  
  When: NLP model processes articles
  Then: Sentiment scores calculated (-1 to +1)
  And: Positive/negative/neutral classified
  And: Aggregate sentiment computed
  
  When: User requests sentiment data
  Then: Current sentiment score returned
  And: Trend chart generated
  And: News feed linked
```

## Performance Testing

### Baseline Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| API latency (p50) | < 50ms | TBD | ⏳ |
| API latency (p95) | < 200ms | TBD | ⏳ |
| API latency (p99) | < 500ms | TBD | ⏳ |
| Throughput | > 1000 req/s | TBD | ⏳ |
| WebSocket connection time | < 100ms | TBD | ⏳ |
| Page load time | < 3s | TBD | ⏳ |
| Dashboard render | < 500ms | TBD | ⏳ |
| Chart render (1000 points) | < 500ms | TBD | ⏳ |

### Load Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Normal Load

```bash
# 20 concurrent users, 2.5 minute test
k6 run tests/load_tests.js \
  --vus=20 \
  --duration=2m30s \
  --tag=scenario:normal_load

# Acceptance Criteria:
# - Error rate < 1%
# - p95 latency < 200ms
# - p99 latency < 500ms
# - No errors in error_rate threshold
```

#### Scenario 2: Stress Test

```bash
# 100 concurrent users, identify breaking point
k6 run tests/load_tests.js \
  --vus=100 \
  --duration=5m \
  --tag=scenario:stress_test

# Acceptance Criteria:
# - System recovers after returning to normal load
# - No data corruption
# - No cascading failures
# - Error rate spikes but returns to < 5% when load reduces
```

#### Scenario 3: Spike Test

```bash
# Sudden traffic spike: 50→500→50 users
k6 run tests/load_tests.js \
  --vus=50 \
  --stages="2m:50,10s:500,2m:50" \
  --tag=scenario:spike_test

# Acceptance Criteria:
# - Auto-scaling triggers
# - Request queuing works
# - No connection timeouts
# - Graceful degradation when overwhelmed
```

#### Scenario 4: WebSocket Load

```bash
# 1000 concurrent WebSocket connections
k6 run tests/load_tests.js \
  --vus=1000 \
  --duration=5m \
  --tag=scenario:websocket_load

# Acceptance Criteria:
# - All connections establish
# - Message delivery reliable
# - Latency < 100ms for price updates
# - Clean disconnection without errors
```
